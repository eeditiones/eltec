# ELTeC: European Literary Text Collection demo app

This TEI Publisher-based application provides quick, facetted browsing, visualisation and full text search of the [ELTeC core](https://www.distant-reading.net/eltec/): a collection of nineteenth-century novels in 11 European languages. The texts are all marked up using a minimal TEI encoding scheme, known as ELTeC Level 1. For each language (Czech, German, English, French, Hungarian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Slovenian, Spanish and Serbian) a balanced sample of 100 titles was made according to explicit criteria to ensure cross-language comparability of the corpora, as further described on the [ELTeC website](https://distantreading.github.io).   [Canonical releases of the datasets](https://zenodo.org/communities/eltec/) are distributed through Zenodo
 and all the texts included in this collection are in the public domain.

Beyond the direct purpose of presenting the ELTeC corpus texts, the application code itself and the accompanying commentary is intended for self-study by TEI practitioners looking for a case study guide: how to publish a larger corpus of TEI encoded material online.
