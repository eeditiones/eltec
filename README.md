# ELTeC: European Literary Text Collection demo app

This is a TEI Publisher-based application aggregating the [ELTeC literary texts](https://www.distant-reading.net/eltec/) encoded at ELTeC Level 1 (where available) for quick, facetted browsing, visualisation and full text search (see [canonical releases of the datasets](https://zenodo.org/communities/eltec/)). All texts included in this collection are in the public domain.

Beyond the direct purpose of presenting the ELTeC corpus texts, the application code itself and the accompanying commentary is intended for self-study by TEI practitioners looking for a case study guide: how to publish a larger corpus of TEI encoded material online.
