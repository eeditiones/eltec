  <title>Introduction</title>
  <para>This is a TEI Publisher-based application aggregating the ELTeC literary texts encoded at
   ELTeC Level 1 (where available) for quick, facetted browsing, visualisation and full text search
   (see canonical releases of the datasets). All texts included in this collection are in the public
   domain.</para>

  <para>Beyond the direct purpose of presenting the ELTeC corpus texts, the application code itself
   and this accompanying commentary is intended for self-study by TEI practitioners looking for a
   case study guide: how to publish a larger corpus of TEI encoded material online.</para>

  <para>This work has been inspired by the e-editiones online community discussion under the working
   title of <emphasis>TEI Vanilla</emphasis> - an effort to ease the learning curve for TEI
   beginners, particularly those who find themselves in leading roles without much institutional
   support or prior experience. We hope that an informal narrative on the encoding and development
   processes and decisions we needed to make will be of use others who face similar
   challenges.</para>

  <title>Encoding</title>
  <!--  <para>schema, data selection, constraints and considerations, tools and methods for
            encoding</para>-->

  <para>ELTeC (European Literary Text Collection) is one of the chief deliverables of EU-funded COST
   action CA 16204 "Distant Reading", developed between 2017 and 2021 (see further
   https://www.distant-reading.net/eltec/). Its encoding and design are exhaustively described in a
   number of working papers; see in particular a short summary paper presented at the TEI 2019
   conference in Graz (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3552489).</para>
  <para>As noted in that paper, the focus of the ELTeC encoding scheme is not to represent texts in
   all their original complexity, nor to duplicate the work of scholarly editors, but rather to
   facilitate a richer and better-informed distant reading than a transcription of lexical content
   alone would permit. Where the TEI permits diversity, ELTeC enforces consistency, permitting only
   a specific and quite small set of textual features, both structural and lexical, along with a
   tightly constrained metadata scheme. </para>
  <para>Following this "No Surprises" principle, the simplest ELTeC schema (the level zero schema)
   provides a bare minimum of tags to mark up the typical structure and content of a nineteenth
   century novel. All preliminary matter other than the title-page and any authorial preface or
   introduction is discarded; the remainder is marked as a <tag class="genentity">div</tag> of <tag
    class="attribute">type</tag>
   <tag class="attvalue">titlepage</tag> or <tag class="attvalue">liminal</tag>, within a <tag
    class="genentity">front</tag> element. Within the <tag class="genentity">body</tag> of a text,
   the <tag class="genentity">div</tag> element is also used to make explicit its structural
   organization, with <tag class="attribute">type</tag> attribute values <tag class="attvalue"
    >part</tag>, <tag class="attvalue">chapter</tag>, or <tag class="attvalue">letter</tag> only. A
   chapter is considered to be the smallest subsection of a novel within which paragraphs of text
   appear directly. Further subdivisions within a chapter (often indicated conventionally by
   ellipses, dashes, stars etc.) are marked using the <tag class="genentity">milestone</tag>
   element; larger groupings of <tag class="genentity">div</tag> elements are indicated by <tag
    class="genentity">div</tag> elements, always of type <tag class="attvalue">group</tag>, whatever
   their hierarchic level. Headings, at whatever level, are always marked using the <tag
    class="genentity">head</tag> element when appearing at the start of a <tag class="genentity"
    >div</tag>, and the <tag class="genentity">trailer</tag> element when appearing at the end.
   Within the <tag class="genentity">div</tag> element, only a very limited number of elements is
   permitted: specifically, in addition to those already mentioned, <tag class="genentity">p</tag>
   or <tag class="genentity">l</tag> (verse line). Within these elements we find either plain text,
    <tag class="genentity">hi</tag> (highlighted), <tag class="genentity">pb</tag> (page break) or
    <tag class="genentity">milestone</tag> elements. It was agreed that it would be practical to
   require only this tiny subset of the TEI for all ELTeC texts. </para>
  <para>In practice, however, encoders found it both feasible and desirable to expand slightly on
   this very restricted set of textual distinctions, and the majority of ELTeC corpora use a
   slightly larger element set, known as eltec level one. </para>
  <para> At level 1, the following additional distinctions may be made in an encoding: <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para>the <tag class="genentity">label</tag> element may be used for heading-like titles
      appearing in the middle of a division;</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>the <tag class="genentity">quote</tag> element may be used to distinguish passages such
      as quotations, epigraphs, stretches of verse, letters etc. embedded in the running text;
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>the <tag class="genentity">corr</tag> element may be used to indicate a passage
      (typically a word or phrase) which is clearly erroneous or nonstandard in the original and
      which has been editorially corrected; </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>the elements <tag class="genentity">foreign</tag>, <tag class="genentity">emph</tag>, or
       <tag class="genentity">title</tag> are available and should be used in preference to <tag
       class="genentity">hi</tag> for passages rendered in a different font or otherwise made
      visually salient in the source, where an encoder can do so with confidence; </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>the element <tag class="genentity">gap</tag> may be used to indicate where some component
      of a source (typically an illustration) has been left out; </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>the elements <tag class="genentity">note</tag> and <tag class="genentity">ref</tag> may
      be used to capture the location and content of authorially supplied footnotes or end-notes;
      wherever they occur in the source, notes must be collected together in a <tag>div
       type="notes"</tag> within a <tag class="genentity">back</tag> element.</para>
    </listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
  </para>
  <para>Texts for inclusion in ELTeC came from many different sources. In most, though not all,
   cases texts were adapted from previously existing digital versions in other formats, typically
   HTML or ePub, though there were also a few existing (and much richer) TEI versions. In other
   cases, texts were available only in visual formats (PDF etc.) which had to be retyped or
   processed with an OCR system. A wide variety of different tools were used.</para>
  <para>To facilitate co-operation and consistency of practice, the texts were all stored and
   managed as a suite of github repositories. As well as syntactic validation of the texts against
   the ELTeC schema using an XML parser, special purpose XSLT stylesheets were used to check in
   detail practice across the project, notably as regards the format of metadata in the header. </para>
  <para>Training material and workshops were also produced to help would-be contributors to the
   project: see, for example, <link
    xlink:href="https://distantreading.github.io/distantreading.github.io/Training/Budapest/encodingGuide-1.html"
    >Encoding Guide 1</link> and <link

  <note>
   <para>This chapter discusses the steps that allowed me to publish the TEI-encoded ELTeC documents
    online. I tried to document and explain not only what I did but also reasoning behind my
    actions.</para>
   <para>I have been working with the setup based on eXist database and used tools and methods I
    personally find best for the job. There are, nevertheless, other possible solutions, based on
    alternative technological choices.</para>
   <para>Magdalena Turska</para>
  </note>
  <section xml:id="generate">
   <title>Generate the base app</title>
   <para>A starting point for this application is the <link
     xlink:href="https://teipublisher.com/exist/apps/tei-publisher/doc/documentation.xml?id=appgen"
     xlink:show="new">TEI Publisher's app generator</link>. TEI Publisher is an open source tool
    which enables scholars and editors to publish their XML-encoded material in a standard-based,
    modular, interoperable, and sustainable manner. If you are not familiar with the TEI Publisher,
    see its <link
     xlink:href="https://teipublisher.com/exist/apps/tei-publisher/doc/documentation.xml"
     xlink:show="new">documentation</link> to learn more.</para>
   <para>With the TEI Publisher you can easily create a complete, standalone application which can
    be tailored further to fit your needs. The generated app can be downloaded as a portable xar
    package, to be installed into any eXist-db instance. It provides a fully functional application
    scaffolding based on TEI Publisher components and modules.</para>
   <para>For the ELTeC application I have used Publisher application generator, supplying basic
    configuration information:</para>
   <figure>
    <title>Base app configuration form</title>
    <mediaobject>
     <imageobject>
      <imagedata fileref="app_generate.png" width="800px"/>
     </imageobject>
    </mediaobject>
   </figure>
   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para><emphasis role="bold">ODD</emphasis></para>
     <para>To start with, I have chosen the default TEI Publisher ODD. It contains a set of
      processing models for TEI elements, recommended by the TEI SimplePrint customization. It seems
      adequate for not very richly encoded material in ELTeC Level 1 dataset.</para>
     <para>In case I will find rendering choices provided by this ODD processing models suboptimal
      for this project, I can always change the default ODD later.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>Application namespace</para>
     <para>Every application package in eXist-db needs to have its own unique identifier. This
      identifier should ideally be a globally unique URI but it doesn't need to correspond to any
      existing web site. It's a good practice to use a domain name for your project's institution
      suffixed at least with the project name.</para>
     <para>In this case I settled for <code>https://www.distant-reading.net/eltec/level1</code>.
       <emphasis>www.distant-reading.net/eltec</emphasis> is the existing ELTeC page, so I just
      suffixed it with <code>/level1</code> since my application addresses the currently available
      Level 1 dataset.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>Abbreviation</para>
     <para>The abbreviation will be used as the name of the root collection of my app. It should be
      unique within the database instance and must not contain spaces or special characters. I
      simply chose <code>eltec</code> here.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>Title of the application</para>
     <para>I simply chose <emphasis>ELTeC European Literary Text Collection</emphasis>. You can
      choose any title you like.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>HTML template</para>
     <para>I opted for a standard TEI Publisher template called <emphasis>Default single text
       layout</emphasis>. I could always change it later if necessary.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>Data collection</para>
     <para>This is the name of a collection where my application stores its data - in ELTeC's case
      all the encoded TEI documents.</para>
     <para>I simply named the collection <code>data</code> thus deciding to keep my data as part of
      the application. It is a reasonable choice for distribution, since we'll only have a single
      package to worry about. ELTeC dataset after reaching mature stage will not be changed (or not
      too often) so this aspect also suggests to keep data with the app and not in a separate data
      package.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>Default view</para>
     <para>This setting defines the default document view - in other words, the default way of
      navigating through the document. In general case it could be to display the whole document at
      once or split either page by page or division by division. In ELTeC's case the choice is easy
      since page divisions are not marked in the encoding, so I chose <emphasis>by
       division</emphasis>. Bear in mind that this is a <emphasis>default</emphasis> view only: in
      general users still can change the view settings.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>User and password</para>
     <para>This setting creates a user for the application which will own all application files. For
      security reasons, it is advisable to create a new account for every app. Make sure to remember
      the user and password!</para>
    </listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
   <para>After filling out the form it was enough to press the <guibutton>Save</guibutton> button
    and the application has been generated for me within the eXist-db instance. I can open the app
    from the Dashboard but it doesn't have any data yet so it doesn't look like much at this
    stage.</para>
  </section>
  <section xml:id="source-control">
   <title>Set up source control with GitHub</title>
   <para>I would like to keep my application in a version control system called
     <emphasis>git</emphasis>. This will allow me to collaborate with others, keep track of changes
    to my code and always have an off-site backup for the project.</para>
   <para><link xlink:href="https://github.com">GitHub</link> is a popular publicly available service
    for git. I have created a new repository within e-editiones organization and called it
     <code>eltec</code>. I chose to initialize the repository with a <emphasis>GNU General Public
     License v.3.0</emphasis> and a <emphasis>readme</emphasis> file.</para>

      <imagedata fileref="git_new.png" width="800px"/>
     </imageobject>
    </mediaobject>
   </figure>
   <para>As soon as the repository has been created I can <emphasis>clone</emphasis> it to my own
    computer. Cloning creates a local copy of the repository. I just need to have a git client
    software installed on my machine.</para>
   <programlisting language="bash" xml:space="preserve">git clone https://github.com/eeditiones/eltec.git</programlisting>
   <para>Since my GitHub repository is public, anyone can execute the <code>git clone</code> command
    and pull the current state of the files onto their computer. A new directory called
     <code>eltec</code> will be created in the current working directory with all the content of the
    remote repository on GitHub.</para>
   <para>Similarly, it is possible to update the content of the remote repository with changes made
    to the local one. Nevertheless, even for a public repository you need to be granted access to
    write to it. In my case, since I have created the eltec repository I am automatically its owner
    and have the privilege to push changes to it.</para>
   <para>Please note that <emphasis>clone</emphasis>, <emphasis>pull</emphasis> and
     <emphasis>push</emphasis> are git commands. Simplifying a bit, <emphasis>clone</emphasis> is
    setting up a local counterpart of a remote repository, <emphasis>pull</emphasis> downloads
    changes from the remote to the local and <emphasis>push</emphasis> uploads changes from local to
    the remote repository.</para>

  </section>
  <section xml:id="synchronize">
   <title>Synchronize to disk</title>
   <para>In the earlier step, I've created an application package. As a result, the application code is stored in the local eXist database instance. I can access it in a web browser or view the code via eXist's editor called eXide. For the further development though I'd like to work directly on my filesystem and regularly push my code to the GitHub repo. I need to synchronize my application package from the database to the filesystem.</para>
   <para>Easy way to do it is to use eXide's XQuery support. I can just execute this simple script
    to synchronize contents of the database to a directory on the disk:</para>
   <programlisting language="xquery" xml:space="preserve">file:sync('/db/apps/eltec', '/Users/magdalenaturska/Sources/ELTEC/eltec', ())
</programlisting>
   <para>The <code>file:sync</code> function takes two paths as parameters: first one is the path to
    the collection in the database and the second the path to the directory in the filesystem. I
    made sure that the second parameter points to the directory where my git repository is cloned
    to.</para>
   <figure>

      <imagedata fileref="data_base.png" width="300px"/>
     </imageobject>
    </mediaobject>
   </figure>
   <para>The illustration above presents the directory structure after synchronization. You will
    note the LICENSE and README.md files which were created via GitHub interface and others,
    generated for me in eXist via TEI Publisher's app generator.</para>
   <para>At this point I can <emphasis>stage</emphasis> my changes in git.</para>
   <programlisting language="bash" xml:space="preserve">git add *
</programlisting>
   <para>In the command above I selected every file and subdirectory to be staged using the
     <code>*</code> wildcard. Usually you'll want to be more selective and only specify certain
    changed files. Numerous git clients with a graphic interface exist to assist with this
    task.</para>
   <para>After I have selected all changes I wanted, it's time to <emphasis>commit</emphasis> and
     <emphasis>push</emphasis> them. The <emphasis>commit</emphasis> action associates all currently
    staged changes with a short explanatory message I need to provide and saves this state. When I
    push to the remote repository afterwards, all changes associated with my commit will be uploaded
    into the remote repository.</para>
  </section>
  <section>
   <title>Collect the data</title>
   <para>At this point, I am almost completely set, the only remaining duty is to add actual data.
    Already filling out the generator's form I have decided to keep all documents within the
     <filename>data</filename> collection of my app. Let's have a look at ELTeC's own repository to
    check what kind of internal organization we're going to need.</para>
   <para>ELTeC itself uses GitHub to make their datasets publicly available, which makes my task
    very easy.</para>
   <figure>
    <title>ELTeC repositories on GitHub</title>
    <mediaobject>
     <imageobject>
      <imagedata fileref="eltec_repos.png" width="600px"/>

    </mediaobject>
   </figure>
   <para>The <link xlink:href="https://github.com/COST-ELTeC" xlink:show="new">COST-ELTeC</link>
    collection groups a number of repositories. Each repository with a name matching the
     <emphasis>ELTeC-{CODE}</emphasis> hosts dataset for a language with a corresponding ISO 639-3
    code, e.g. <emphasis>ELTeC-pol</emphasis> for Polish, <emphasis>ELTeC-eng</emphasis> for English and so
     on.</para>
   <para>Each of these repositories has the same internal structure, where
     <filename>level1</filename> subdirectory contains all TEI files conformant with the ELTeC
    Level1 guidelines.</para>
   <figure>
    <title>ELTeC-eng level1</title>

      <imagedata fileref="eltec_level1.png" width="600px"/>
     </imageobject>
    </mediaobject>
   </figure>

   <para>I have already created a directory called <filename>ELTEC</filename> and cloned my
     <filename>eltec</filename> repository into it. I can clone all the ELTeC-* repositories there
    as well:</para>
   <programlisting language="bash" xml:space="preserve">git clone https://github.com/COST-ELTeC/ELTeC-eng.git
</programlisting>
   <para>Obviously, I need to run the git clone command for every language. It's a bit tedious but I
    only need to do it this once.</para>
   <figure>
    <title>Local copies of all ELTeC repositories</title>
    <mediaobject>
     <imageobject>
      <imagedata fileref="eltec_all.png" width="500px"/>
     </imageobject>
    </mediaobject>
   </figure>
   <para>Since the work on data is ongoing, I decide that for now I'll only include languages which
    reach <emphasis>green</emphasis> conformance score according to <link
     xlink:href="https://distantreading.github.io/ELTeC/">this overview</link>: German, English,
    French, Hungarian, Portuguese, Romanian, Slovenian and Spanish. I'll follow ELTeC's example and
    create a subdirectory for each language, named according to 3-letter ISO code.</para>
   <para>To achieve this, I need to copy contents of level1 subdirectory for each language into
    corresponding subdirectory in data collection of my app, e.g.:</para>
   <programlisting language="bash" xml:space="preserve">cp ELTeC-eng/level1/* eltec/data/eng/
</programlisting>
   <para>When all the data is copied I can again stage the changes, commit and push to GitHub. This
    time I'm selecting only the content of my data directory:</para>
   <programlisting language="bash" xml:space="preserve">git add data
    git commit -m "upload eltec novels"
    git push
</programlisting>
   <para>I need to be taking notes for this tutorial, so I'm already adding yet another data folder
    and call it <filename>commentary</filename>. Directory structure on my filesystem now looks like
    this (most sub-folders collapsed, only the Spanish collection expanded):</para>
   <figure>

  </section>
  <section xml:id="deploy">
   <title>Build and deploy</title>
   <para>Since all the operations on the data collection were performed on my computer's filesystem,
    nothing has changed in the database. Previously we learned how to synchronise
     <emphasis>from</emphasis> the database to the filesystem, but now we need to reverse the
    direction to be finally able to view all the ELTeC novels via our app.</para>
   <para>There are several ways to do it, let's start with the <emphasis>build and deploy</emphasis>
    strategy. With all necessary parts of the application now residing in the filesystem, we can
    just build an application package. Exist-db supports the <emphasis><link

    system in which all necessary resources: application code and data are bundled together in the

   <note>
    <para>To create the xar archive you need to have the <parameter>ant</parameter> program
     installed.</para>

   <para>I already do, so I just move to the directory where my app is stored and run

   <title>Application styling</title>
   <para>Each of the pages we can visit in a Publisher-based app uses a certain HTML page template.
    These templates reside in the <filename>templates</filename> collection. Our start page, the one
    displaying the document list, is stored in <filename>index.html</filename>. This is where we
    need to start if we would like to change anything.</para>

   <para>First, I'll just upload an image file to <filename>resources/images</filename> and add HTML
    code to insert it into the menubar.</para>
   <programlisting language="html" xml:space="preserve">
    &lt;app-toolbar class="menubar"&gt;
         &lt;a href="${app}/index.html" class="logo" data-template="pages:parse-params">
             &lt;img src="resources/images/eltec-logo.jpeg"/>
         &lt;/a>
     ...
    &lt;/app-toolbar>
   </programlisting>

   <para>With the code above, the logo unfortunately looks a bit distorted, so I'll have to fix the
    CSS styling. All TEI Publisher HTML template files import the <filename>theme.css</filename>
    stylesheet which specifies application-wide styles. I could change it directly, but a better
    practice would be rather to import a new, custom CSS file which overwrites selected properties.
    This way, updating to the new version of Publisher I can import its new
     <filename>theme.css</filename> and benefit from default configuration, without worry about
    losing my customizations.</para>

   <para>I will therefore create an <filename>eltec.css</filename> file and import it in my
     <filename>index.html</filename> template.</para>

   <title>Static pages</title>
   <para>As already said, this ELTeC app is conceived as a case study, therefore I'll need a space
    for this commentary. My idea is to add a link to the menu so it is easy to find. Like with the
    logo, I will start with the <filename>index.html</filename> page.</para>



   <para>Menubar contains a section which is displayed only on a device with a viewport of at least
    1024 pixels wide. This is where I will add my <emphasis>"About"</emphasis> page link.</para>


   <programlisting language="html" xml:space="preserve">
&lt;pb-media-query query="(min-width: 1024px)">
    &lt;a href="${app}/index.html" data-template="pages:parse-params">Start&lt;/a>
    &lt;a href="${app}/commentary/about.xml" data-template="pages:parse-params">
       About
    &lt;/a>
              ...    
              
   </programlisting>

   <para>You will note that the link leads to the <filename>commentary/about.html</filename>
    document. Already mentioned in the section we discussed the internal structure of the data
    directory, I created this subcollection to be able to easily exclude any commentary or other
    content from ELTeC documents themselves.</para>

  <section>
   <title>Facets and indexes</title>

   <para>As we have seen, changing the look and feel of the generated app is not too hard, at least
    if you know basic HTML and some CSS tricks. We'll see that it is perhaps even simpler to
    customize facets. This subject is covered in general in the <link
     xlink:href="https://teipublisher.com/exist/apps/tei-publisher/doc/documentation.xml?id=facets"
     >TEI Publisher documentation</link>, but I'll discuss here the specifics of the ELTeC
    data.</para>

   <para>All ELTeC documents contain a certain basic set of metadata which we can use to provide a
    convenient set of facet dimensions for quick filtering of the whole dataset. In particular, it
    would be good to offer facetted search by language, period, length and perhaps the number of
    reprints of the work.</para>

   <programlisting language="html" xml:space="preserve">
    &lt;TEI xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="HU13802" xml:lang="hu">

            &lt;canonicity xmlns="http://distantreading.net/eltec/ns" key="low"/>
            &lt;timeSlot xmlns="http://distantreading.net/eltec/ns" key="T3"/>
         &lt;/textDesc>
      &lt;/profileDesc>
   </programlisting>

   <para>TEI Publisher pre-defines two facets: <emphasis>Genre</emphasis> and
     <emphasis>Language</emphasis>. We will need to add facets for gender, period, size and reprint.
    Genre doesn't make very much sense for ELTeC corpus, since all documents are novels, so I'll
    remove it, in order not to waste the screen space.</para>

   <para>There are 3 places which need adjusting for the facet configuration:</para>
   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para><filename>modules/config.xqm</filename> defines which facets should be displayed by
      default in the facets panel</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para><filename>collection.xconf</filename> stores the index configuration</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para><filename>index.xql</filename> stores functions (if any) referenced by
      collection.xconf</para>
    </listitem>
   </itemizedlist>

   <para>We cannot use facets until relevant indexes with facet definitions are created. Therefore
    our first stop will be <filename>collection.xconf</filename> where we'll be adding new
    facets.</para>

   <programlisting language="xml" xml:space="preserve">
&lt;text match="/tei:TEI/tei:text">
  ...             
  &lt;facet dimension="genre" expression="nav:get-metadata(ancestor::tei:TEI, 'genre')" hierarchical="yes"/>
  &lt;facet dimension="language" expression="nav:get-metadata(ancestor::tei:TEI, 'language')"/>
  &lt;facet dimension="author" expression="nav:get-metadata(ancestor::tei:TEI, 'author')"/>            
&lt;/text>
   </programlisting>

   <para>You will notice there are several facets already defined for the <code>/TEI/text</code>
    nodes. We'll just add a few more:</para>

   <programlisting language="xml" xml:space="preserve">
&lt;facet dimension="period" expression="nav:get-metadata(ancestor::tei:TEI,
  'period')"/>
&lt;facet dimension="gender" expression="nav:get-metadata(ancestor::tei:TEI, 'gender')"/>
&lt;facet dimension="size" expression="nav:get-metadata(ancestor::tei:TEI, 'size')"/>
&lt;facet dimension="reprint" expression="nav:get-metadata(ancestor::tei:TEI, 'reprint')"/>
   </programlisting>

   <para>Definitions in the collection configuration file are rather short, offloading the work of
    actually specifying where to get the facet values to the <code>get-metadata()</code> function of
    the <filename>index.xql</filename> module. What follows, we need to add handling of the new
    facets there as well. Since the whole function is basically a <emphasis>switch</emphasis>
    statement, we'll need add relevant <emphasis>case</emphasis> expressions for each of newly
    defined facets.</para>

   <para>In this step we need to specify XPath (or XQuery) expressions pointing at the data to be
    used for the facet value. In ELTeC, we'll find them in the <code>textDesc</code> section of the
    TEI header, in <code>@key</code> attribute of the <code>timeSlot</code>,
     <code>authorGender</code>, <code>size</code> and <code>canonicity</code> elements,
    respectively. Please note that these elements are not TEI elements, but belong to a custom
     <code>http://distantreading.net/eltec/ns</code> namespace.</para>

   <programlisting language="xquery" xml:space="preserve">
    declare function idx:get-metadata($root as element(), $field as xs:string) {
    let $header := $root/tei:teiHeader
    return
        switch ($field)
            ...
            case "period" return
                $header//tei:textDesc/*:timeSlot/@key
            case "gender" return
                $header//tei:textDesc/*:authorGender/@key
            case "size" return
                $header//tei:textDesc/*:size/@key
            case "reprint" return
                $header//tei:textDesc/*:canonicity/@key
            ...
            default return
                ()
};
   </programlisting>

   <note>
    <para>Please note that in the index.xql, the function get-metadata is prefixed as
     idx:get-metadata, while in collection.xconf the same function is referenced as
     nav:get-metadata. Please remember that the prefix is inconsequential, as long as the actual
     namespace is the same, in this case <code>http://teipublisher.com/index</code>, as specified in
     the collection.xconf and index.xql .</para>

    <programlisting language="xml" xml:space="preserve">
     collection.xconf 
     
       &lt;lucene>
            &lt;module uri="http://teipublisher.com/index" prefix="nav" at="index.xql"/>
            ...
    </programlisting>

    <programlisting language="xquery" xml:space="preserve">
     index.xql
     
    module namespace idx="http://teipublisher.com/index";
    </programlisting>
   </note>

   <para>Having adjusted the definitions, I can finally change what is being displayed in the facet
    sidebar, by tweaking the <code>$config:facets</code> variable in
     <filename>modules/config.xqm</filename>. It is a series of maps, one for each facet to be
    displayed. The pre-defined <emphasis>language</emphasis> facet's configurations looks like this
    by default: </para>
   <programlisting language="xquery" xml:space="preserve">
    map {
        "dimension": "language",
        "heading": "facets.language",
        "max": 5,
        "hierarchical": false(),
        "output": function($label) {
          switch($label)
                case "en" return "English"
                case "de" return "German"
                case "es" return "Spanish"
                case "fr" return "French"
                case "en" return "English"
                default return 
                    $label
        }
    }
   </programlisting>

   <para>As we can see it works but some labels show only the language code, while others the
    correct English name of the language. Reason for this behaviour is the function to handle the
    displayed label, specified in the <code>output</code> property of our map. We can easily extend
    the mapping to cover other country codes used in ELTeC, just adding relevant
     <emphasis>case</emphasis> expressions.</para>

   <programlisting language="xquery" xml:space="preserve">
                case "pt" return "Portuguese"
                case "pl" return "Polish"
                case "sl" return "Slovenian"
                case "ro" return "Romanian"
                case "hu" return "Hungarian"

                (: erroneous but used in ELTec:)
                case "SPA" return "Spanish"
   </programlisting>

   <para>Language facet is configured to show no more than 5 most frequent values. I think it would
    be more convenient for the users to see all available languages at once, so I'll increase the
    value of the <code>max</code> property to 15.</para>

   <para>I am now almost happy with the result, except for the fact that facet counts for different
    languages exceed number of documents in each language collection. Quick consultation with Lou
    explains the mystery: default TEI Publisher's configuration uses the <code>@ident</code>
    attribute on <code>langUsage/language</code> if available, and only falls back to<code>
     TEI/@xml:lang</code> or <code>teiHeader/@xml:lang</code> if not. ELTeC documents use the
    langUsage/language to list all languages occurring in the document, which causes the perceived
    inconsistency.</para>

   <programlisting language="xquery" xml:space="preserve">
   case "language" return
      head((
          $header//tei:langUsage/tei:language/@ident,
          $root/@xml:lang,
          $header/@xml:lang
      ))
  </programlisting>

   <para>Solution is simple, adjusting the <emphasis>"recipe"</emphasis> in index.xql to only use
     <code>@xml:lang</code>:</para>

   <programlisting language="xquery" xml:space="preserve">
   case "language" return
        $root/@xml:lang
  </programlisting>

   <para>I need to remember to reindex the collection before my changes are operational but after
    doing so, the language section in the sidebar finally looks good.</para>

   </figure>

   <para>Phew, now we know how to do it, let's repeat for all other facets: gender, period, size and
    reprint count. We have already prepared the ground in <filename>collection.xconf</filename> and
     <filename>index.xql</filename> so only need to take care of extra maps in
     <filename>config.xqm</filename>, e.g. for period we could do it like this:</para>

   <programlisting language="xquery" xml:space="preserve">
    map {
        "dimension": "period",
        "heading": "Period",
        "max": 5,
        "hierarchical": false(),
        "output": function($label) {
            switch($label)
                case "T1" return "1840-59"
                case "T2" return "1860-79"
                case "T3" return "1880-99"
                case "T4" return "1900-20"
                default return $label
        }
    }
   </programlisting>

   <para>Note how we again use the <code>output</code> property to translate between T1, T2 etc
    period markers to human readable date spans.</para>

   <title>Internationalization</title>

   <para>Facets sidebar looks good in English, but changing the interface language e.g. to Polish we
    note that our new facet headings have not been translated. No wonder, since we just hardcoded
    the English labels in <filename>config.xqm</filename>.</para>
   <figure>

     </imageobject>
    </mediaobject>
   </figure>

   <para>TEI Publisher's pb-components library provides a number of different language files
    (currently covering 20 languages) with translations of all labels it uses. In custom
    application, we'll sooner or later need to define new labels, and if these are supposed to be
    localized, we'll need our custom language files. Fortunately, TEI Publisher provides a
    convenient mechanism to add custom labels.</para>

   <figure>
    <title>Internationalization</title>

      <imagedata fileref="index_i18nstructure.png" width="200px"/>
     </imageobject>
    </mediaobject>
   </figure>

   <para>Custom language files need to reside in the <filename>resources/i18n/app</filename>
    subcollection. I will create a JSON file for each language and call it after the 2-letter ISO
    country code with .json extension.</para>

   <para>Each of the files has identical JSON structure, only translated labels will differ. My aim
    is to have ELTeC app available in each of its languages, so I need to ask for help in
    translations. Fortunately, members of the ELTeC team were very quick to assist.</para>

   <programlisting language="js" xml:space="preserve">
{
    "eltec": {
        "facets": {
            "size": "Długość",
            "authorGender": "Płeć autora",
            "period": "Zakres czasowy",
            "reprint": "Liczba reprintów"
        }
    }
}
   </programlisting>

   <para>Final step is to change the hardcoded label into a reference to a language file. This is
    easy in Publisher, since it will first check if the <code>heading</code> property of a facet
    matches a label in custom language file. So all I need to do is change the "Period" into
     <code>eltec.facets.period</code> and so on.</para>



   <programlisting language="xquery" xml:space="preserve">
    map {
        "dimension": "gender",
        "heading": "eltec.facets.authorGender",
        ...
    }
   </programlisting>
